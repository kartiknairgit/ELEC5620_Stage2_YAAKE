## Project Evaluation

This project demonstrates comprehensive full-stack development of an AI-powered recruitment intelligence platform built for ELEC5620. Our team successfully integrated multiple LLM-based agents, implemented Agile development practices throughout the development lifecycle, and leveraged advanced technologies to deliver a production-ready system that bridges the employment gap between candidates and opportunities.

| Criteria | Achievement Description | Points |
|----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Comprehensiveness of Functions and Features (8 Marks)** | Delivered complete intelligent recruitment platform with full feature implementation: (1) Resume ATS scoring system with real-time compatibility analysis, keyword extraction, and formatting validation providing instant feedback to applicants; (2) AI-powered mock interview generator creating personalized behavioral, technical, and situational questions with adaptive feedback mechanisms and performance scoring; (3) Intelligent cover letter generation producing multiple style variations (formal, conversational, persuasive) with iterative refinement capabilities and job-description alignment; (4) Multi-agent architecture featuring Resume Intelligence Agent, Communication Agent, Career Guidance Agent, Recruiter Agent, and Training Agent working collaboratively through defined interfaces; (5) Skills gap analysis with automated course recommendations matching candidate profiles to training opportunities; (6) Recruiter tools including AI-assisted job post creation with bias detection, automated interview scheduling with calendar integration, and customizable question bank generation; (7) Complete authentication system with role-based access control supporting three user types (applicants, recruiters, training teams). All features thoroughly tested with comprehensive edge case handling (file format validation, API rate limiting, concurrent sessions, invalid inputs), robust error handling with user-friendly feedback, and smooth UX validated through testing. System handles complex workflows including resume optimization iterations, interview session state management, and multi-user concurrent operations without performance degradation. | 8/8 |
| **LLM-based Agent: Perception, Decision-making, and Interaction (5 Marks)** | Fully integrated multi-agent system powered by OpenAI GPT-4 and Claude APIs with five specialized intelligent agents demonstrating autonomous operation and collaboration. **Resume Intelligence Agent** performs deep resume analysis using NLP for keyword density evaluation, ATS algorithm simulation, section-by-section scoring, and content quality assessment, generating prioritized improvement suggestions with clear reasoning and impact ratings. **Communication Agent** generates personalized cover letters and professional correspondence through context-aware content generation, analyzing job descriptions to highlight relevant candidate qualifications while maintaining appropriate tone and style. **Career Guidance Agent** delivers comprehensive interview preparation by researching target companies, generating role-specific questions across multiple categories, providing structured feedback on response quality with specific improvement recommendations, and tracking candidate progress over multiple practice sessions. **Recruiter Agent** automates hiring workflows with intelligent job post creation including market benchmarking and inclusive language verification, generates customized interview questions aligned with candidate backgrounds and role requirements, and schedules interviews with conflict resolution. **Training Agent** performs sophisticated skills gap analysis comparing candidate competencies against job market demands, recommends targeted courses with justification for coverage and relevance, and tracks engagement metrics for enrollment optimization. All agents demonstrate clear perception (understanding user context and extracting relevant information), intelligent decision-making (ranking recommendations by impact, filtering irrelevant suggestions), and natural interaction (conversational interfaces supporting iterative refinement with detailed feedback explaining agent reasoning). System implements feedback loops where user interactions improve recommendation quality over time. | 5/5 |
